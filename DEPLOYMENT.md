6. Click "Deploy site"

#### Option B: Drag & Drop

1. Run `npm run build` locally
2. Drag the `build` folder to Netlify's deploy area

### Step 3: Configure Forms

Your contact form is already configured with Netlify Forms! After deployment:

1. Go to your Netlify site dashboard
2. Navigate to "Forms" to see submissions
3. Set up email notifications in "Forms" â†’ "Settings"

## Advanced Setup (Optional Database)

If you want to add database functionality later:

2. Create a new project
3. Copy your connection string

### Step 2: Add Environment Variables

In your Netlify site dashboard:

1. Go to "Site settings" â†’ "Environment variables"
2. Add:

```
DATABASE_URL = your-neon-connection-string-here
NODE_ENV = production
```

### Step 3: Database Setup

```bash
# Generate and push schema
npm run db:generate
npm run db:push
```
